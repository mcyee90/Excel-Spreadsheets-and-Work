# Excel-Spreadsheets-and-Work

The spreadsheet contains data of over 4,000 KickStart Projects and the money fundraised and the goals that the project shot for.

I used Excel to modify and anlyze the data to uncover some market trends. The state of the project was conditionally formatted. Additionally, the percent funded based on initial goal was created to show what percentage of the initial ask was successfully fundraised for. This column was also color coded. Other columns including category and sub-category were created as well as average donation amount. Data for month and year was created as well as categories for goals.

Once the data was cleaned and set up, pivot tables and pivot charts were created to analyze the data sets. I analyzed whether a project successfully raised money based on the sub-category. Pivot tables and charts were also created for monthly fundraisers as well as goal categories. Pivot charts for these were created using the count-if functions.
